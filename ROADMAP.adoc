== Phase 1: Foundation Hardening

Target: Stabilize current implementation, improve data coverage

=== Data Expansion

* [ ] Expand material database (50+ materials with full metrics)
* [ ] Add garment categories (activewear, formal, outdoor, etc.)
* [ ] Expand brand database (30+ brands with certifications)
* [ ] Add certification details (GOTS, OEKO-TEX, B-Corp, etc.)
* [ ] Include care instruction templates per garment type

=== Bot Improvements

* [ ] Add command cooldowns and rate limiting
* [ ] Implement embed pagination for long lists
* [ ] Add interactive buttons/menus (Discord UI components)
* [ ] Improve error messages and user guidance
* [ ] Add help command with dynamic documentation

=== Testing & Quality

* [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage
* [ ] Add end-to-end Discord bot tests
* [ ] Implement load testing
* [ ] Add property-based testing for algorithms

== Phase 2: Enhanced Features

Target: Add advanced functionality and intelligence

=== Carbon Footprint Calculator

* [ ] Per-garment carbon footprint estimation
* [ ] Production + transport + care lifecycle analysis
* [ ] User wardrobe carbon tracking
* [ ] Comparison with industry averages
* [ ] Reduction suggestions

=== Wardrobe Tracking

* [ ] Personal wardrobe database per user
* [ ] Cost-per-wear calculations
* [ ] Garment age and usage tracking
* [ ] End-of-life recommendations
* [ ] Donation/recycling suggestions

=== Smart Recommendations

* [ ] User preference learning
* [ ] Personalized sustainability suggestions
* [ ] Brand matching based on values
* [ ] Budget-aware recommendations
* [ ] Location-aware suggestions (local brands)

=== External Integrations

* [ ] Good On You API integration
* [ ] Open Apparel Registry data
* [ ] Fashion Revolution resources
* [ ] Life Cycle Assessment databases

== Phase 3: Platform Expansion

Target: Multi-platform support, web presence

=== Web Dashboard

* [ ] User profile web view
* [ ] Statistics and visualizations
* [ ] Wardrobe management interface
* [ ] Brand/material browser
* [ ] REST API for frontend

=== Multi-Platform Bot

* [ ] Slack integration
* [ ] Telegram integration
* [ ] Matrix/Element integration
* [ ] Unified command interface

=== Database Migration

* [ ] PostgreSQL support
* [ ] Redis caching layer
* [ ] Database migrations (Alembic)
* [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

== Phase 4: Intelligence Layer

Target: ML-powered features

=== Machine Learning

* [ ] Image recognition for garment identification
* [ ] Material detection from photos
* [ ] Care label OCR
* [ ] Personalized recommendation engine
* [ ] Trend analysis and predictions

=== Advanced Analytics

* [ ] Community sustainability metrics
* [ ] Server-wide impact reports
* [ ] Seasonal trend analysis
* [ ] Environmental impact projections

== Phase 5: Language Migration

Target: Migrate to Rust/ReScript per language policy

=== Migration Strategy

Per `.claude/CLAUDE.md` language policy:

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Component |Current |Target

|Backend/Core
|Python
|Rust

|Bot Logic
|Python (discord.py)
|Rust (serenity)

|Web Frontend
|N/A
|ReScript

|CLI Tools
|Python
|Rust

|Configuration
|TOML/ENV
|Nickel

|Runtime
|Python
|Deno (for JS glue)
|===

=== Migration Phases

. *Phase 5a*: Rust core library
** Data models in Rust
** Sustainability algorithms in Rust
** Database layer (diesel/sqlx)

. *Phase 5b*: Rust Discord bot
** Migrate to serenity crate
** Maintain feature parity
** Performance optimization

. *Phase 5c*: ReScript web dashboard
** Frontend in ReScript
** Compile to JS, run on Deno
** Type-safe UI components

. *Phase 5d*: Remove Python
** Archive Python implementation
** Full Rust/ReScript stack
** Update CI/CD

== Long-Term Vision
